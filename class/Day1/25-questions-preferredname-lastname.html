 <h1>Personal Reflection 1: 25 Questions</h1>
 <ol>
 <li>What are you unsure of as an artist?</li>
 <li>I am extremly puzzled and even quite upset towards the overall outcome of this absurdly expensive art aducation which is kindly suggesting me to work as a server for many years to focus on my "work" that is beautiful in my mind but questionable for others or sparks for a short amount of time at a gallery. However, I feel excited to find the doors that I can knock on though converting my medium to the internet since it's more in touch with a bigger audience.</li>
 <li>Why do I feel so?</li>
 <li>Is it because of the majority of the "artists" are poor and are mostly in service industry?</li>
 <li>How could you distinguish someone if the person is visual talented?</li>
 <li>I believe visually talented people "see" things in more details. When they can elaborate it with their words, the joy of critique just fill up the room by the sound of their words. If they are well trained to render what's in their mind into a physical/digital form, the person suddenly shines. If the person's message contains the universial humanistic meanings, with a mind blowing way of presenting, I would run to the person just to see how they talk, walk, sit, and smile. My believe in visual people is that they get more disturbed by inharmonious visual elements, which makes them impossible to make something visually unappealing at that point. Oh right, only if they pursue perfection.</li>
 <li>What do you want to learn?</li>
 <li>How to build an interactive 3D portfolio website that users want to dwell in there regardless of their purpose to visit the website. I want to put my nature on web, letting users to joyfully get immursed into it.</li>

 <li>Do I want to be “successful”?</li>
 <li>Yes. How dare you ask me this after charging me about $350k for this degree?</li>
 <li>What does “success” even mean to me?</li>

 <li>“How do I support myself financially?”</li>
 <li>I got paid for doing branding, selling my paintings, building websites and apps for businesses. I love utilizing my talent and being appreciated but living as a hustler for forever.. sounds a little bit exhausting. Or maybe I currently am a little already there.</li>
 <li>What am I talented at?</li>
 <li>I am born visually sensitive, am fast at cathing and absorbing the invisable informations around me and representing them into my virble/visual langueages. </li>
 <li>What's the meaning that I care in life?</li>
 <li>I want to eventually share the good things in my life, especially the exitment of learning which has been leading me to better places.</li>

 <li>What's my narrative?</li>
 <li>I was born and raised in Korea, then has been moving around in between Chicago, Dubai, and NYC. Through out the whole journey, I have explored the big big world and the deep deep nature of myself. Peter Doig, David Hockney and Nicole Eisenman's paintings were the fellows that I grew up with during my teenage year, but then when the glame of Kpop hit the world, it opened up my eyes of the power of branding in mess media and has been stolen my heart ever since I captured them in Dubai world EXPO.</li>
